= Git Team Training Assignment -- Team Greeting Project

NOTE: Disclosure: partially AI generated content

== Overview

This assignment teaches collaborative Git workflows using a simple "Team Greeting Project". Four students (S1, S2, S3, S4) will work together on a shared repository, practicing:

* Repository creation and cloning
* Branch creation and management
* Commits and pushing
* Pull Requests (GitHub)
* Merging and rebasing
* Merge conflict resolution
* Tagging/labeling releases
* Rollback (reverting commits)

== Prerequisites

* Git installed on each student's machine
* GitHub account for each student
* Basic command line knowledge

=== Merge vs. Rebase

*Merge*

* Combines two branches by creating a _merge commit_ (unless it can fast-forward). 
Preserves the original branch structure and history.
* Use when:
** You want an _audit-friendly_ history with explicit integration points
** The branch is _shared_ and you want to avoid rewriting history
** Your workflow prefers visible merge points for PRs

*Rebase*

* Replays your commits onto a new base to create a _linear_ history. 
This _rewrites commit IDs_.
* Use when:
** You want to update your feature branch onto the latest `main` before/while working on a PR
** You want to clean up your own commits (squash/fixup) before merging
** Your team prefers a linear history on `main`

*Rule of thumb*

* Use `merge` for shared branches and when preserving history matters.
* Use `rebase` for keeping your own branch current/clean, but _don't rebase commits others already pulled_ (unless coordinated with a force push).


== Project Description

You will create a simple team greeting project consisting of:

* A `team.txt` file listing team members
* A `greeting.sh` script that displays a greeting
* A `config.txt` file with project settings

== Important Notes

* `<REPO_URL>` = The GitHub repository URL created by S1 (e.g., `https://github.com/student1-username/team-greeting.git`)
* Each student works in their own local directory
* Students should coordinate timing (wait for previous steps to complete)
* All students must use their real names instead of "Student 1", etc.

== Verification Checklist

After completing all steps, verify:

* [ ] Repository has 3 tags: v1.0, v1.1, v2.0
* [ ] team.txt contains all 4 students
* [ ] config.txt has correct (non-broken) content
* [ ] greeting.sh has improved message
* [ ] bonus.txt exists with Features A and C
* [ ] cleanup.txt exists with 4 lines
* [ ] Git history shows merges, reverts, and various branches

== Common Issues and Solutions

=== "Permission denied" when pushing
Ensure you were added as collaborator (T7) and accepted the invitation.

=== Merge conflicts during rebase
Don't panic! Edit the file to include both changes, then `git add` and `git rebase --continue`.

=== Forgot to set local user config
Run `git config user.name "Your Name"` and `git config user.email "your@email.com"` in the repo directory.

=== Push rejected after rebase
Use `git push --force-with-lease origin <branch-name>` (only for YOUR feature branches, never for main!).
